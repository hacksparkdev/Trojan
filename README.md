# Trojan Framework

A flexible and modular Trojan framework that dynamically loads and executes Python modules from a GitHub repository. This framework allows for remote configuration and control, making it adaptable to various tasks.

## Features

- **Dynamic Module Loading**: Fetch and execute Python modules directly from a GitHub repository.
- **Remote Configuration**: Control the execution of the Trojan through a remote configuration file.
- **Custom Importer**: Use a custom Python module importer to load modules from a remote repository.
- **Threaded Execution**: Execute multiple tasks concurrently using threading.
- **Data Storage**: Store results and logs back to the GitHub repository.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**: Ensure that Python 3.7 or a later version is installed on the target system.
- **GitHub API Token**: You need a GitHub API token with repository access to use this framework.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hacksparkdev/Trojan.git
   cd Trojan
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install the required Python packages using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Set Up the GitHub API Token**:
   - Create a file named `secret.txt` in the root directory.
   - Add your GitHub API token to this file.

4. **Configure Your Trojan**:
   - Customize the `config/{trojan_id}.json` configuration file to define which modules to run.
   - Use the `trojan_config.json` file to control the remote execution of the Trojan.

## Usage

1. **Running the Trojan**:
   - You can start the Trojan by running the main script:
     ```bash
     python trojan.py
     ```

2. **Monitor the Execution**:
   - The Trojan will periodically check the remote repository for configuration updates.
   - Results and logs will be stored in the `data/{trojan_id}/` directory in the GitHub repository.

3. **Adding Modules**:
   - Place your Python modules in the `modules/` directory in the GitHub repository.
   - Update the configuration file to include the new modules.
